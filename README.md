# gitbacker.py

This is a (relatively) simple but still somewhat thorough script for backing up one's github presence. It can be used to backup a user's owned repositories, starred repositories, and owned/starred gists.

Please place your credentials (username/OAuth token) into gitbacker.ini and see **./gitbacker.py -h** for more information.
